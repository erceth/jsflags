JSFlags

## About

Robot AI tanks and game engine written 100% in nodeJS and javascript from scratch. A rewrite of [this](https://github.com/chris-clm09/bzflag) BTZFlag Python game. Tanks move about a 2d world shooting enemy tanks and stealing flags for points. Actions of tanks are recieved from a Javascript written artificial intelligence. Goal was to write the game with as few dependencies as possible to make the game super portable and easy to set up. This project is written to be a fun hackathon where each member creates an AI and battle each other. I also plan to make several improvments from the original python game including a manual mode. Still in development. View in Chrome.

## How to set up

- Download jsflags
- node index.js
- open localhost:8003 in Chrome
- run [jsflags-ai](https://github.com/erceth/jsflags-ai) to connect 

## More info
